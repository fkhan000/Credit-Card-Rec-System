100,000 Bonus Points After You Spend $5,000 On Purchases In The First 3 Months From Account Opening: The product is not available to either (i) current cardmembers of any Sapphire credit card, or (ii) previous cardmembers of any Sapphire credit card who received a new cardmember bonus within the last 48 months. If you are an existing Sapphire customer and would like this product, please call the number on the back of your card to see if you are eligible for a product change. You will not receive the new cardmember bonus if you change products. To qualify and receive your bonus, you must make Purchases totaling $5,000 or more during the first 3 months from account opening. ("Purchases" do not include balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable.) After qualifying, please allow 6 to 8 weeks for bonus points to post to your account. To be eligible for this bonus offer, account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment.

Earning in the Rewards Program: You'll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card by you or an authorized user of the account. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn points: hotel accommodation purchases through Chase Travel that qualify for the $50 Annual Chase Travel Hotel Credit, balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 2 points ("2X points") on travel purchases: You'll earn 2 points for each $1 spent on purchases made in the travel category. 5 points ("5X points") on Chase Travel purchases: You'll earn 5 points total for each $1 spent on purchases made using your card through Chase Travel (3 additional points on top of the 2 points earned on each purchase in the travel category). Any hotel accommodation purchases made using your card through Chase Travel that qualify for the $50 Annual Chase Travel Hotel Credit, won't earn points. "$50 Annual Chase Travel Hotel Credit" means the statement credit that is automatically applied to your account annually on hotel accommodation purchases made using your card through Chase Travel, up to an annual maximum accumulation of $50. "Annually" means the year beginning with your account open date through the first statement date after your account open date anniversary, and the 12 monthly billing cycles after that each year. 3 points ("3X points"): You'll earn 3 points for each $1 spent on purchases in the following rewards categories: dining at restaurants including takeout and eligible delivery services; select streaming services; online grocery (excluding Target®, Walmart® and wholesale clubs). 1 point ("1X points"): You'll earn 1 point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. 10% anniversary points bonus: Each account anniversary year, you'll earn bonus points that equal 10% of your total spend in points from purchases made with your credit card during the previous account anniversary year at a rate of 1 point for each $1 spent. "Account anniversary year" means the year beginning with your account open date through the anniversary of your account open date, and each 12 months after that. How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and pay with points for products or services made available through the program or directly from third parties. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. For important information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQsOpens in a new window.

Third-Party Merchants: The listed merchant(s) are in no way affiliated with Chase, nor are the listed merchant(s) considered sponsors or co-sponsors of this program. All trademarks are the property of their respective owner(s).

$50 Annual Chase Travel Hotel Credit: A statement credit will automatically be applied to your account when your card is used for hotel accommodation purchases made through Chase Travel, up to an annual maximum accumulation of $50. Annual means the year beginning with your account open date through the first statement date after your account anniversary, and the 12 monthly billing cycles after that each year. Annually, the first $50 in Chase Travel hotel purchases will not earn rewards points. Statement credit(s) will appear on your monthly credit card billing statement within 1-2 billing cycles after your purchase posts to your account.

Book Through Chase Travel: When you use points to redeem for cash, each point is worth $.01 (one cent), which means that 100 points equals $1 in redemption value. Each point you redeem for travel booked through Chase Travel is worth $.0125 (one and a quarter cents), which means that 100 points equals $1.25 in redemption value, and points are worth 25% more than if redeemed for cash. For example, 60,000 points are worth $750 when redeemed for travel purchases, or $600 when redeemed for cash. The cost of travel is based on the rates and fares available through Chase Travel, including the online portal and call center, and may not reflect all rates and fares that are available through other sales channels.
If you choose to use points and your Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card to pay for your purchase, each point will be worth $.0125, but your credit card will be charged the full remaining dollar amount.
