Cash Back And Points: Rewards Program Agreement: For more information about the Chase Freedom Unlimited rewards program, view the latest Rewards Program Agreement (PDF)Opens in a new window. We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com/ultimaterewardsOpens in a new window.
Cash Back and Points: “Cash Back rewards” are the rewards you earn under the program. Cash Back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in Cash Back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see “Cash Back” in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you earn. You may also see, “points” or “Ultimate Rewards points” when referring to the points you can use. How you can earn points: You’ll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card by you or an authorized user of the account. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won’t count and won’t earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 1.5% Cash Back: You’ll earn 1.5% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent. 3% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent on purchases in the following rewards categories: drugstores and dining at restaurants including takeout and eligible delivery services (1.5% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). 5% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent on purchases made using your card through Chase Travel (3.5% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and pay with points for products or services made available through the program or directly from third parties. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don’t expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won’t qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category.
