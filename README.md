# Credit-Card-Rec-System

To train the model, make sure to download the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/credit-card-transactions and place the csv files in the data folder (except for sd254_cards.csv file which should already be there). Then run the train_test_split.py file in the src folder to split the dataset into a train and test set. Finally, go to the src folder and run the command python -m card_rec.train
